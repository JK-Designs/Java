## What is included in this repository?
This repository contains my source code to the 'programming projects' section at the end of each chapter of the text. The questions themselves are listed in the comment headers of each project and the projects are named according to chapter and problem number. For example, the first problem from chapter one will be named 1.1 and the first problem from chapter two would be named 2.1.

### Note to students...
Please don't use this code as a direct answer to exercises assigned by your teacher. This repository is meant to be a learning aid as well as a practice space for myself. Direct duplication of this source code may result in disciplinary action from your institution's academic authorities due to plagiarism. While some problems may appear to have a single solution, such as the print statement exercises from chapter one, others may be addressed in a number of ways.
